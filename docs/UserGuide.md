Thanks for using CMDo! Let's get started right away.

## Quick Start

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough.
   >
   > This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
   
1. Download the latest `CMDo.jar` from the [releases](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-F11-C2/main/releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your CMDo. A folder `data` will be created to store your task list XML file. You may change this at anytime. Refer to [here](##-`storage`-file-path-may-be-changed).
3. Double-click the JAR file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. 

## Orientation

1. Tasks in CMDo are sorted accordingly, hence, tasks that are closest to the deadline will be at the top, as shown below.<br><br>

2. Tasks are coded as follows

    #### Text Color
    <img src="images/UGTextColorBlack.png" width="70"><br>
    Black: Regular tasks
    
    <img src="images/UGTextColorRed.png" width="70"><br>
    Red: Overdue tasks

    Done tasks<br>
    <img src="images/done.png" width="50"><br>
    
3. Calendar
    Displays from year ### to year #### so you can use CMDo your whole life :) (Rather, you are able to have a quick glance at the months ahead of you)

    <img src="images/calendar.png" width="300"><br>

4. Side bar
    Displays cateregories of task with a counter at the side of the number of tasks for each category.
    
    <img src="images/taskcategory.png" width="300"><br>

5. CMDo is a commands-based application. Enter a command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. <br>
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window. 
   
6. Some example commands you can try:
   * **`list all`** : lists all tasks
   * **`add`**` 'email prof damith to feedback on the module on wednesday'` : 
     adds a task named `email prof damith to feedback on module` to your ToDo List.
   * **`delete`**` 1` : deletes the task at index 1 “email prof damith” in the current list
   * **`exit`** : exits the app
7. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.<br>

# Features

## `add` tasks #LikeASiri

You may add due-by tasks, with relative, explicit or floating date-time inputs. CMDo understands everyday language.
```
# Due-bys
add 'give me some sugar' tmr at noon                  # relative date and time
add 'give me some coffee' on 10/31/2016 at noon       # explicit date, relative time
add 'give me some candy' on 10/31/2016 at 2230        # explicit date and time
add 'give me some' at 3pm                             # implicit today 
add 'give me some money' tmr                          # floating time
add 'give me'                                         # floating

# Events
add 'give me some sugar' from tmr to 10/31/2016       # you get the idea
```

## `block` time slots #LikeABoss

You may block off time slots to prevent conflicting tasks. Tasks may not be added to the blocked date/time range.
```
block 'CS2103 exam' tmr                           # entirety of tomorrow is blocked, no tasks may be added inclusive of tomorrow
block 'CS2103 tutorial' from 11am to 12pm         # 11am - 12pm today is blocked, no tasks may be added inclusive of the time range
block 'visit Bolivia' at 11am                     # 11am - 12pm (1h enforced) today is blocked
block 'night of fun' from 10/31 11pm to 11/1 6pm  # 11pm (10/31) - 6pm (11/1) is blocked.
block 12pm                                        # impossible. Secret mission? Give it a name at least.
```

## `done`? Mark them and get on with your life

You may mark a task as `done` at anytime. All you need is the index that the task has on the list.
```
done 1                                  # all done with task 1 (on list)
done give me some                       # invalid
```
Does it make sense to mark a done task as done? No, so don't do it.

## `edit` tasks in the same way

You may edit tasks by first keying in the index of the task in the [list](#List them all). Type in only the fields you are interested in changing. Be warned, in this iteration, you cannot undo an edit.
```
edit 1 'new name'                 # changes the detail
edit 2 -new tag                   # replaces all tags with `-new` 
edit 3 /medium                    # changes the priority to `medium`
edit 4 tmr at noon                # relative date and time
edit 1                            # actually impossible.
```

## `find` tasks with Power Search (wow)

Are you a goldfish who has about 1,384,103 things to do on your list? You may find tasks using specific keywords! (Add `--done` to search through done tasks)
```
find word                     # pulls up undone tasks with 'word' in their detail or tag
find high                     # pulls up undone tasks with 'high' in their priority, detail or tag
find tmr 1300                 # pulls up undone tasks with tomorrow's date, 1300 in their date/time parameters 
                                # or 'tmr 1300' in their detail or tag
find --done keyword           # pulls up done tasks with 'keyword' in their detail
find my keys                  # no we don't do that sort of thing

\# Do note todolist understands your spelling errors/ambiguity and will pull out similar tasks for you. 
```

## `list` them all

How do you list tasks, you ask? Super simple!
```
list                                                # lists all undone tasks
list all
la

list done                                           # lists all done tasks
ld

list block                                          # lists all blocked timeslots
lb

ls                                                  # woah woah woah, what are you thinking?
```

## `storage` file path may be changed

You may change the storage file `cmdo.xml`'s location as an when you like.
```
storage                                 # defaults to location data/
storage data/test/cmdo.xml              # valid
storage anywhere/cmdo.xml               # valid
storage anywhere                        # valid (!)
```

## `undo` and `redo` your last action

You may undo and redo add, block, clear, delete, done, edit commands. Basically commands which modify any tasks in the todo list.
```
undo                        # undoes one step
redo                        # redoes one step
```

## `up` and `down`, `top` and `bottom`

You can navigate through CMDo by typing!
```
up
u                           # move up
down
d                           # move down
top
t                           # teleport to the top of the list
bottom
b                           # teleport to the bottom of the list
```
